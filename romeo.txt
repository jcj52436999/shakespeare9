ROMEO AND JULIET

In fair Verona where we lay our scene...

SOME GUY: I bite my thumb at you, sir!

JULIET: Ay, me!

ROMEO: What light through yonder window breaks?

JULIET: Oh poison, nice.

ROMEO: Oh cool a dagger. Bye.

THE END

P.S. Romeo resents and regrets his malignment as a Casanova, he maintians that he was loyal to Julietta for all time, it was that Casanova that slept around!
